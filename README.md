# i4GZuriTask

From my knowledge of PHP forms and files, PHP loops, functions and sessions, 
I'm to create a basic authentication page that does the following:

//1. Register (a new user can register, their details stored in a database file). 
//2. Login (checks in the file and logs them in if they are already registered)
//3. Reset password and then
//4. Logout
